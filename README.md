## Purpose

This personal project is an attempt at implementing a media hosting app supporting multiple formats (WebM, WebP,
PNG, JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, ...), using Python, PyAV and learning React in the process.

## Installing

Do not install for now, here be dragons.

The frontend is not yet started, for the backend, if you really want to (you should use a virtualenv) :

```bash
# installing production dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# installing development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-devel.txt
# running the app
python backend
```
